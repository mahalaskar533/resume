          I am a frontend developer with a strong interest in web technologies and a passion for creating modern, user-friendly interfaces. 
          I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
          I have experience in responsive design, animations, form handling, and working with user interfaces.

          I also have a solid understanding of both frontend and backend development. 
          Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, I can develop dynamic websites and applications.

          During my university studies, I completed several full-fledged web projects. 
          In these projects, I learned how to handle user data, store it in a database, and retrieve it efficiently. 
          I used PHP for form handling and building an authorization system, and MySQL for database operations.

          I actively use Git and GitHub for team projects. 
          I constantly explore new technologies and aim to become a professional web developer.

          As a student, I created websites and small web applications and worked on real-world projects.
